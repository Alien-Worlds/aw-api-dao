			'I am running as a candidate who will bring new ideas to the table, and represent the people (and aliens of course!) - not just the powerful. If I am elected, the people and aliens of Kavian will determine how I use my authority to vote as a membber of the Kavian Council. \n\nAs Custodian for Kavian, I will work to develop a "Claim &amp; Stake" system,, where you earn more trillium per mine, but it is immediately staked to the planet upon claiming. This means more Trillium for miners. More miners for land. More stakers for Kavian!\n\nDuring my first term in office, I will introduce a proposal to develop a "Claim &amp; Stake" exploratory committee in order to determine the best course of action.\n\nThis is just one example of the type of creative thinking I will bring to the table as your Custodian. <b><br /></b><b>VOTE Tophinity!</b>',

			"I campaign for: #1.) Better tool & shine balance. #2.) TLM funding for Kavian -based content and community events. #3.) Active satellite DAOs, ensuring Kavian's position as the leading planet in AW. #4.) Minimum commission rate of 5% across all lands in Kavian, making the landowner competition & communities more vibrant - ultimately benefiting the miners as well.\n\nI've also made AW short animations on YT:\nhttps://tinyurl.com/fifthace\n\nAnd I have a relatively quiet, but brutally honest discord server for AW related things:\nhttps://discord.gg/d2suvNXRak",

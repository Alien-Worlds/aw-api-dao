                            Also known as Second Earth or Terra Alterna as it is
                            the nearest, and closest, of all Alien Worlds to
                            Earth. Humans found Eyeke inhabited by a Monastic
                            order of Greys who believe that Eyeke is a spiritual
                            place. Despite initial fears, Trilium mining seems
                            to be tolerated by the Monks at this time.

                            Magor has the most hostile planetary environment in
                            the federation. Due to the volcanic activity, the
                            sky is covered in smoke and the terrain is extremely
                            mountainous. There are no permanent settlements but
                            the sandy part of Magor is considered an anomaly; It
                            is rumoured that the sand covers many ancient
                            secrets.

                            people have made the forests of Neri their home but
                            they aim to live in balance with nature so casual
                            visitors may not even notice the colonies.

                            has some of the most beautiful landscapes found thus
                            far in the universe. It's islands are home to some
                            unique exoflora. Nordic aliens often visit Veles on
                            their travels and some have made it their main home.

                            to be tolerated by the Monks at this time.

                            Although most land on Kavian is rocky and icy, there
                            are some unusual areas where  diverse bio-systems
                            have flourished. Legend has it that these areas were
                            terraformed by ancient aliens. Kavian has a number
                            of small Reptiloid villages.

                        For the record:   

                        I have never voted from a second wallet.   

                        I do not run bots.   

                        And I am not & never was part of any plan to take Kavian
                        tokens.   


                        No one from the AW nor Krown community gave me any prior
                        information of the movement of these funds.   I was not,
                        and am not involved.   


                        Those that have worked with me in the space over the
                        last 5 years will know that I promote and work towards
                        transparency, reputation & governance.

It is my believe that we can ensure the prosperity of all parties involved by creating a healthy and fair environment. Our Banano and CryptomonKeys track record insures that miners, stakers and land owners are all going to be heard and that any decision will be based on what is best for the ecosystem!\_Some extra information about me: I have been involved with cryptocurrencies for the past 3 years on a personal basis. Since September 2020 I have started writing about NFTs on my blog in Publish0x and since the early days I have been a member of the CryptomonKeys community. When Alien Worlds started I saw the need to help new players and especially those that don't have deep pockets, thus I created the Help the Monkey Mine Foundation that lends tools to miners in need.

                        Good day citizens of Neri, Cardinal Quack here! I first
                        arrived on this planet in September 2021. I've been an
                        active miner since that time. I found myself with the
                        opportunity to purchase the Methane Swampland on which I
                        spent most of my days mining. I now run with the
                        cryptomonKeys and Banano clan. I enjoy the fun and
                        gamification they and others have added to the community
                        and culture. Such community projects have my full
                        support!


                        I can relate to both miners and land owners. I am by no
                        means a galactic whale. I have a vested interest in
                        seeing our community thrive and stand the test of time.
                        I hope build on this metaverse and add to the community
                        regardless of my role in the DAO. You can follow
                        @CardinalQuack on Twitter. I look forward to working and
                        learning with all of you and would be most honored for a
                        chance to serve on the Planetary Council. A vote for The
                        Cardinal is a vote for the people and the future of
                        Neri. Thank you all!

                        Hello All! I have been a big believer of Alien Worlds
                        and joined right after this game started! I have been
                        working on different projects in the Sammy Snake
                        Community and helped build nft staking contracts for
                        multiple games on wax. I believe my knowledge and skills
                        along with the many friends I have made along the way
                        can help create a fun and enjoyable experience. I am
                        currently helping build the Miners Union and Mission
                        Control. I believe together we can build a better
                        experience on wax and bring more people to our favorite
                        game. Thank you.

                        Hello Nerians! Skywalker here. I've been involved with
                        blockchain and cryptocurrency technology since 2013,
                        full time since 2018, where I worked with the Dacoco
                        team on eosDAC, a community-owned EOS block producer and
                        DAC enabler. I've also been involved in the Steem
                        ecosystem since 2016 and was a consensus witness as we
                        defended the community from attack and birthed the Hive
                        blockchain. I've worked with FIO Protocol (an EOSIO
                        chain) as the Managing Director. I'm passionate about
                        blockchain governance systems and how to use them to
                        help create a world we all want to live in. A vote for
                        me is a vote for someone you can trust to support action
                        which increases our ability to function and is
                        passionate about evolving our consciousness together.

                        I have never voted from a second wallet.   

                        I do not run bots.   

                        And I am not & never was part of any plan to take Kavian
                        tokens.   


                        No one from the AW nor Krown community gave me any prior
                        information of the movement of these funds.   I was not,
                        and am not involved.   


                        Those that have worked with me in the space over the
                        last 5 years will know that I promote and work towards
                        transparency, reputation & governance.

It is my believe that we can ensure the prosperity of all parties involved by creating a healthy and fair environment. Our Banano and CryptomonKeys track record insures that miners, stakers and land owners are all going to be heard and that any decision will be based on what is best for the ecosystem!\_Some extra information about me: I have been involved with cryptocurrencies for the past 3 years on a personal basis. Since September 2020 I have started writing about NFTs on my blog in Publish0x and since the early days I have been a member of the CryptomonKeys community. When Alien Worlds started I saw the need to help new players and especially those that don't have deep pockets, thus I created the Help the Monkey Mine Foundation that lends tools to miners in need.

                        and typography (100M+ downloads), with an emphasis on
                        community-engagement with crypto tokens.


                        Utilizing social engagement in the arts and design, Max
                        has created opportunities and activities for various
                        communities to participate, connect, grow, while
                        intersecting with technology. 


                        Currently, Max leverages components of DAOs to support
                        and engage communities. He primarily works with Dacoco
                        the publisher of Alienworlds.io 


                        Max is one of the artists in Curio Cards
                        www.curio.cards, the very first art (NFTs) on Ethereum
                        in 2017, where he released artwork under the name
                        Marisol Vengas. These works were sold at Christie's and
                        Sotheby's in October 2021.


                        When not designing software for future users-- he also
                        produces fine art and design in his studios in Chico,

                        Good day citizens of Neri, Cardinal Quack here! I first
                        arrived on this planet in September 2021. I've been an
                        active miner since that time. I found myself with the
                        opportunity to purchase the Methane Swampland on which I
                        spent most of my days mining. I now run with the
                        cryptomonKeys and Banano clan. I enjoy the fun and
                        gamification they and others have added to the community
                        and culture. Such community projects have my full
                        support!


                        I can relate to both miners and land owners. I am by no
                        means a galactic whale. I have a vested interest in
                        seeing our community thrive and stand the test of time.
                        I hope build on this metaverse and add to the community
                        regardless of my role in the DAO. You can follow
                        @CardinalQuack on Twitter. I look forward to working and
                        learning with all of you and would be most honored for a
                        chance to serve on the Planetary Council. A vote for The
                        Cardinal is a vote for the people and the future of
                        Neri. Thank you all!

                        Hello All! I have been a big believer of Alien Worlds
                        and joined right after this game started! I have been
                        working on different projects in the Sammy Snake
                        Community and helped build nft staking contracts for
                        multiple games on wax. I believe my knowledge and skills
                        along with the many friends I have made along the way
                        can help create a fun and enjoyable experience. I am
                        currently helping build the Miners Union and Mission
                        Control. I believe together we can build a better
                        experience on wax and bring more people to our favorite
                        game. Thank you.

                        Hello Nerians! Skywalker here. I've been involved with
                        blockchain and cryptocurrency technology since 2013,
                        full time since 2018, where I worked with the Dacoco
                        team on eosDAC, a community-owned EOS block producer and
                        DAC enabler. I've also been involved in the Steem
                        ecosystem since 2016 and was a consensus witness as we
                        defended the community from attack and birthed the Hive
                        blockchain. I've worked with FIO Protocol (an EOSIO
                        chain) as the Managing Director. I'm passionate about
                        blockchain governance systems and how to use them to
                        help create a world we all want to live in. A vote for
                        me is a vote for someone you can trust to support action
                        which increases our ability to function and is
                        passionate about evolving our consciousness together.

It is my believe that we can ensure the prosperity of all parties involved by creating a healthy and fair environment. Our Banano and CryptomonKeys track record insures that miners, stakers and land owners are all going to be heard and that any decision will be based on what is best for the ecosystem!\_Some extra information about me: I have been involved with cryptocurrencies for the past 3 years on a personal basis. Since September 2020 I have started writing about NFTs on my blog in Publish0x and since the early days I have been a member of the CryptomonKeys community. When Alien Worlds started I saw the need to help new players and especially those that don't have deep pockets, thus I created the Help the Monkey Mine Foundation that lends tools to miners in need.

                      Max made his first alternative "viral currency" with a
                      public ledger in 2007. He has 15+ years in art, design and
                      typography (100M+ downloads), with an emphasis on
                      community-engagement with crypto tokens.


                      Utilizing social engagement in the arts and design, Max
                      has created opportunities and activities for various
                      communities to participate, connect, grow, while
                      intersecting with technology. 


                      Currently, Max leverages components of DAOs to support and
                      engage communities. He primarily works with Dacoco the
                      publisher of Alienworlds.io 


                      Max is one of the artists in Curio Cards www.curio.cards,
                      the very first art (NFTs) on Ethereum in 2017, where he
                      released artwork under the name Marisol Vengas. These
                      works were sold at Christie's and Sotheby's in October
                      2021.


                      When not designing software for future users-- he also
                      produces fine art and design in his studios in Chico, CA.


                      As a Candidate for the Planetary DAOs - Syndicates, if
                      elected, Max will use his experience in extending the
                      Alien Worlds metaverse.
